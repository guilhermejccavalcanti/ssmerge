The featurehouse (fh) toolsuite was developed in Eclipse and
uses some of the features Eclipse provides.

After cloning the entire repository with git 5 different components
should appear as separate projects in the Eclipse Package
Explorer (CIDE_generateAST, CIDE2_ast, fstcomp, fstgen, and
fstmerge). Each project comes with all necessary libraries and
all dependencies between the projects are allready set.

requirements:
  - openjdk jre
  - git (ubuntu: apt-get install git)
  - R (for evaluation of fstmerge results;
    ubuntu: aptitude install r-recommended)

fstcomp:
fstgen:
  - project that creates the parsers from annotated grammars
    for the projects fstcomp and fstmerge
  - remember to re-create the parsers after changing the grammars
  - re-creation is done with and ant build script (see test/build.xml)
  - before running the build.xml make sure that in the configuration
    of the build script the Runtime JRE is set to: Run in the same JRE
    as workspace (otherwise recreation of parsers does not work)
fstmerge:
  - project that implements semistructured-merge for different
    programming languages (C#, Java, and Python)
  - fstmerge relies on the other 4 projects
  - there are two example run-configurations in the folder
    run_configurations; right-click -> [Run As]
