After all merge operations have been applied, we use several scripts and programs to
evaluate our approach.

First of all we sum up all merge conflicts that occur in a software system. Therefor,
apply the script ./writeAllResults-JAVA.sh ../examples/jEdit (./writeResults-PY.sh and
./writeResults-CS.sh for python respectively csharp projects). The script creates two
csv files (one for unstructured merge and one for semistructured merge).
